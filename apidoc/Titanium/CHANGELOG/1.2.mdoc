### Notes

The following are miscellaneous platform specific notes related to 1.2.

#### iPhone and iPad

For iPhone/iPad, this release adds support for both 3.1 and 3.2 of the iPhone SDK.  Applications compiled against 3.2 will continue to work on older devices, however, new 3.2 APIs will not be available on older devices not yet upgraded to 3.2.  To check during runtime for the devices version, you should check the value of `Titanium.Platform.version` and `Titanium.Platform.name`.

The following code snippet can be used to determine if the user is running on a device that supports iPhone OS 3.2 or above.

~~~
function isIPhone3_2_Plus()
{
	// add iphone specific tests
	if (Titanium.Platform.name == 'iPhone OS')
	{
		var version = Titanium.Platform.version.split(".");
		var major = parseInt(version[0]);
		var minor = parseInt(version[1]);
		
		// can only test this support on a 3.2+ device
		if (major > 3 || (major == 3 && minor > 1))
		{
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}
~~~

On iPad, the media player can now play not only fullscreen but within custom views.  You can now embed the media player into your own view.

On iPad, the photo gallery is now displayed in a popover control instead of a full screen view.  This change was required by Apple for the 3.2 release.  You can now control the location of the popover by specifying a `popoverView` and `arrowDirection` property on <a href="/apidoc/mobile/1.2/Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery">Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery</a> to control the location and arrow of the popover.
